# Uber Data Analysis in R

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Uber data using the R programming language. The analysis explores various aspects of Uber's operations, including trip patterns, demand distribution, and peak hours. The project is implemented as an R notebook, making it easy to replicate and understand the analysis steps.

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, which contains Uber trip data. The dataset includes information such as date and time of trips, trip distances, pickup and drop-off locations, and other relevant attributes. The dataset provides a rich source of information for exploring different aspects of Uber's operations.

The dataset used for this analysis can be found at the following link:

## Analysis Steps

The analysis is structured into the following main sections:

1. Data Loading and Exploration: The dataset is loaded into R and an initial exploration of the data is performed. This section includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming variables if necessary.

2. Data Visualization: Various visualizations are created to gain insights into the data. This includes exploratory plots such as bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and geographical visualizations using maps.

3. Time-based Analysis: The dataset is analyzed based on time-related factors such as hour of the day, day of the week, and month. This section provides insights into peak hours, weekly patterns, and monthly trends.

4. Location Analysis: The geographic aspect of Uber's operations is explored by analyzing pickup and drop-off locations. Heatmaps, geospatial visualizations, and clustering techniques are used to identify hotspots and popular areas.

5. Conclusion and Insights: The analysis concludes with a summary of the findings and key insights derived from the dataset. This section highlights interesting patterns and trends observed throughout the analysis.

## Usage

To run the analysis notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

<pre>git clone https://github.com/VaibhavMishra1341/Uber-Data-Ananlysis.git</pre>

2. Ensure that you have R and the required packages installed. You can install the necessary packages by running the following command in R:
```R
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "ggplot2", "leaflet", "plotly", "ggmap"))

    - Open the notebook file (Uber_Data_Analysis.Rmd) in an R-compatible IDE or Jupyter Notebook environment.

    - Execute the code cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis. Modify the code or explore the data further to suit your needs.
